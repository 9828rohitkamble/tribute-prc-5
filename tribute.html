    <p>Shivaji I (Shivaji Bhonsle; Marathi pronunciation:19 February 1630 â€“ 3 April 1680[5]), also referred to as ChhatrapatiShivaji Maharaj, 
        was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.[6] Eventually, Shivaji carved out his o
 the Maratha Empire. 
        In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.</p>  
        <p>Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. 
        Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.
         Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations.
         He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and administration</p>
